# WorldAPI
This WorldAPI was initially made for my server, however I have switched to SWM.
I still think that this API can come in handy for some people, so here is it.

## Information
What I should mention: This is by no means a replacement for a good worldmanager like multiverse, I made this API exclusively for minigames. That's also the reason you are not able to set a worldname and instead will receive an uuid as a string.
(In case its not clear, my intention was to load a temporary world — hence the uuid — for a minigames and then delete it when its no longer needed)

## Usage
First you have to get the WorldAPI instance. To do so include this code in your @onEnable methode.  
`worldapi = new WorldAPI().getAPI();`
after that you have 7 methodes to work with:
```java
/**
 * returns the name of a random File / Dictory in the given folder.
 *
 * @param Path of a folder
 * @return
 */
public String getRandomFile(String path);


/**
 * Deletes the directory with all files in it.
 *
 * @param Path of the directory to delete
 * @return
 */
public boolean deleteDirectory(File path);


/**
 * Unloads the World and deletes the directory of the world
 *
 * @param World
 * @return
 */
public boolean removeWorld(String world);


/**
 * Loads a zip file as a world with a given name.
 * @param file ZIP File
 * @return true if the world loaded successful and false if not
 */
public boolean loadMap(File file, String name);


/**
 * Loads a zip file as a world
 *
 * @param file ZIP File
 * @return Name of the loaded world or null if an error has occurred
 */
public String loadMap(File file);


/**
 * Saves the mentioned world as an ZIP File.
 * However it does not save the world ingame. So its best combined with a "Bukkit.getWorld(world).save();"
 * @param world World that will be saved
 * @param output Requires a path and filename with the .zip extention like: worlds/world.zip
 * @param compress Should the zip file be compressed or just store the world
 * @return true if the world was saved successful and false if not
 */
public boolean saveMap(String world, File output, boolean compress);


/**
 * Loads a world directory if its already in the server folder. If there is non, it will create a new void world.
 *
 * @param worldname
 */
public void loadAsVoid(String worldname);
```
